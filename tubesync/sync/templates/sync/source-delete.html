  Are you sure you want to delete this source? Deleting a source is permanent.
  By default, deleting a source does not delete any saved media files. You can
  <strong>tick the &quot;also delete downloaded media&quot; checkbox to also remove directory {{ source.directory_path }}
  </strong>when you delete the source. Deleting a source cannot be undone.
